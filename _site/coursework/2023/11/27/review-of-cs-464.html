    <p>I recently had the opportunity to take CS 464, Open Source Software, as an Ecampus student at Oregon State University. 
I liked this class so much that I decided to write a review about it.</p>

<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>

<p>The course consisted of 4 short quizzes, weekly discussions, and a final portfolio project.
I appreciated the minimalistic nature of the course structure.
The flexible requirements allowed me to delve deeper into whatever open-source project I wanted.</p>

<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>

<p>The assignments are mainly designed to make sure you are making progress toward your portfolio assignment and just generally interacting with open-source projects. 
Moreover, you had to submit a proposal beforehand for each assignment, which essentially was a draft.
The proposals did a great job of keeping me on track. 
I struggle with starting tasks, so having these checkpoints was invaluable.</p>

<h3 id="discussions">Discussions</h3>

<p>The discussions served as additional check-ins, had some reading about open-source concepts, and let you explore open-source projects.</p>

<h3 id="portfolio-project">Portfolio Project</h3>

<p>For your portfolio project, you had to contribute a significant change to an open-source project. 
I decided to contribute to a project I already used called homepage. 
Homepage allows you to create dashboards for your homelab.</p>

<p>One of the features that I like is that you can configure your dashboard from a docker-compose file. 
However, the docker integration lacked support to configure bookmarks from the compose file. 
I wrote this feature and hope to have it merged soon.
You can see my pull request <a href="https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage/pull/2367#issuecomment-1827150820">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>If you are looking for an excuse to contribute to open-source, this course is for you. 
I have made open-source contributions in the past, but I needed more structure to ensure I made more significant contributions. 
This class has reignited my passion for open-source, and I am very thankful I took it.</p>
